Scraping Teaching faculty information from CSE department of Karunya University using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

More info about the code:
This code is using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape teaching faculty details from the Computer Science and Engineering department at Karunya University. It uses the Chrome webdriver to load the page, finds the relevant elements using their tags, and extracts the text from them. The code then cleans and structures the data into separate lists for names, designations, and email IDs. Finally, it writes the data to a CSV file and loads it into a Pandas dataframe for display.
